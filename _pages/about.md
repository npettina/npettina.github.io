I graduated from the University of Oregon in 2022 with a B.S. in Physics with Departmental Honors and minors in Biology and Mathematics. Much of my undergraduate research examined bacterial motility and species interactions in the context of the zebrafish gut microbiome with the [Parthasarathy Lab](https://pages.uoregon.edu/raghu/), but later transitioned into developing machine learning models to classify bacterial species from imaging data. For a glimpse into this research, see [Sundarraman, et al (2020)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33051365/).

In August 2022, I began working with the [Nehme](https://www.nehmelab.org/) and [McCarroll](https://mccarrolllab.org/) Labs in the Stanley Center for Psychiatric Research at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard studying iPSC-derived neurons. My projects leveraged the ["village-in-a-dish"](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.29.174383v1.full) model to study how natural variation in human genetics influences the response to both genetic and pharmacological perturbations. 

I have extensive experience working in the following areas:
* Construction of various optical instruments for use in biological contexts (light-sheet fluorescence microscopy, two-photon polymerization, custom bacterial macroscopy)
* Characterization of physical properties of motile bacterial colonies and their relation to diffusive properties
* Assay development to characterize bacterial interactions in various gut microbiome contexts
* Analysis of RNA-seq data to learn about the biological mechanisms underlying psychiatric and neuroinflammatory disorders
* Use of genotyping (WGS, GSA) data from human iPSCs to understand the role of natural genetic variation in disease and drug response

In my free time, I am currently self-studying foundational topics in astronomy to pursue the passion I've had for space science since I was a kid! Currently, my research interests lie in:
* Exoplanets and planetary systems
* Extragalactic astronomy and cosmology
* Galaxy formation and evolution
* Astronomical surveys
